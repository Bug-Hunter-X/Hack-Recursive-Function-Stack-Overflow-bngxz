This repository contains a simple Hack program that demonstrates a common error: a stack overflow caused by unbounded recursion.  The `foo` function calculates the factorial of a number using recursion. For large inputs, this recursion goes too deep, leading to a stack overflow. The solution demonstrates how to resolve this by adding appropriate checks and potentially using iterative approaches.
